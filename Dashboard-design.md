Presenting data and focusing on design when creating a dashboard seems easy enough but there are some simple things you can do to make the message clearer and quicker for the user to understand.



Organise the dashboard
Users look first for information on the top and left, then down the left side, but the bottom and right may not be noticed at all.



White Space is your friend
Maximising slide real estate also means creating places for the eye to "rest" so that the non-white space has more impact.  When we don't have sufficient spacing, everything runs together and we can't see what is most important.



Colour
Colour draws your eye to what is important and ties together similar things.  Increase brightness and maximise contrast to attract attention and make a point seem more important.  Use flat colours, not gradients, it makes the scale clearer.



Typography
The key is for your message to be easy to read and understand.  More is not always better when selecting a set of fonts.  Use readable labels and don’t repeat yourself.  It’s not necessary to have both a legend and a title for single series graphs.



Chart Types
There are two major types of data:

Categorical - gender, colour
Quantitative - age, weight, number of children


Bar Chart: For categorical data
Use 5 - 7 categories
Use the horizontal axis for time and start scales at 0
Consider using horizontal bars as they can be easier to read


Line Chart: Trends over time
Use data labels to point out important trends
Keep intervals equal and don’t skip data points
Consider combining with a bar chart to answer more questions


Scatter Plot: Relationship between two variables
Data points show the point of intersection between the two variables.
Outliers skew the data so watch out for these


Pie Chart: Proportions of a whole
Only use two-three variables, the message gets lost with more
DO NOT use 3D pie charts as it is impossible to see the size of the pieces


Tables
Use tables when:

You need to compare or look up individual values.
You require precise values.
Values involve multiple units of measure.
The data has to communicate quantitative information, but not trends
