Pivot tables allow you to organise and summarise your data without changing the source data itself.

Building a Pivot table takes under a minute and is an incredibly useful tool for slicing and dicing your data without the need for time-consuming reports.

## Set up

1 - Highlight the sheet you want to use</br>
2 - Go to Insert Pivot Table on the ribbon</br>
3 - Select that you want it to be generated in a new sheet and let the wizard do the work</br>


## Formatting
The PivotTable field list appears on the right-hand side.  You can now drag the fields to the different areas to summarise and organise your data.

### Filters:

### Rows and Columns: 
Show rows on the left-hand side and columns across the top

### Values: 
By default will show the Count of that field but can be changed by clicking and selecting 'Value Field Settings' to show Sum, Average, % of column total and perform calculation
