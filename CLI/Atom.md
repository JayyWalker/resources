Atom does all the things you expect from a text editor, it allows you to edit text, it colours the text in your language of choice but also has some great features built by the community

## Minimap
Lets me see the outline of the script on the right-hand side so if I need to move around the script I can scroll there quickly.

## Change Case
Changes case to not only upper and lower but also kebab, camel and other cases depending on what you need.

## Beautifier
Quickly formats and indents code where it should in a couple of clicks.  No more trying to keep everything consistent slowly and painfully by myself.

## Linter
Shows me the errors I've made, where they are and a colour coded scale of how bad the error is.

## Open in browser 
Lets me right click and open a file right from Atom instead of having to open explorer and track it down first.

Bonus ... Before I started using Atom I used to have an index.html boilerplate saved so I could copy and paste it in when I started a new project.  Now I create a new index.html and in the first line type HTML then ENTER to get started.

Another bonus ... Atom shortcuts are incredibly useful but my favourite is 'alt-f3' to find all and select to change all instances of something in one go.
