Excel functions make your life easier to calculate, analyse and clean up data. These five functions convert text so it's consistent.



PROPER, LOWER, UPPER
To change the case of a cell using one functions insert a new column to the right of your data and use the functions below.  Don't forget to copy and 'Paste Values' to make the values remain.



=PROPER(A1)
Changes the text from the cell in the brackets to Proper case



=LOWER(A1)
Changes the text from the cell in the brackets to lower case



=UPPER(A1)
Changes the text from the cell in the brackets to UPPER case


Trim
Sometimes when importing data extra spaces can be added in the process.  To remove these, we use the TRIM function:

=TRIM(A1)
Removes any spaces before or after the text in the brackets 



Concatenate
This function is useful for putting a First Name and Last Name field back together with one step.

=CONCATENATE(B2," ",A2)
Pastes B2 and A2 together in one cell with one space in between.
